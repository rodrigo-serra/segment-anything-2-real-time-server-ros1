# TODO
- [ ] CAD (.obj or .ply) Models generation;
- [ ] Test megapose with unknown objects and respective CAD models;

# Notes
- If detectron and camera image take to long to provide a sync answer, consider having the code inside detectron (somehow);

# Changes to default repo (happypose, not happypose_ros1)
- ```pip install Flask```

# Useful cmds
- List conda envs
```
conda env list
```

- Delete env 
```
conda env remove -n happypose
```
